# testrun.org

Author: missytake@systemli.org

testrun.org is a playground; many people do different things here. Not
everything is documented, but there is etckeeper to keep track of changes.

It runs on a VPS in the Hetzner Cloud; the DNS settings are at Hetzner as well.

Many users have sudo; passwords are not required.

Mostly postfix, dovecot, and a static nginx site are running here.

testrun.org offers an API for burner accounts, the code is here:
https://github.com/deltachat/playground/tree/master/tadm

Docker is installed, but only used if someone needs it.

## Mail Server Administration

End of December 2019 we noticed that some mails to mailbox.org don't arrive, if
the recipient's Spam filter is set to `strict`.

I added an SPF record to the Hetzner DNS:

```
@      IN TXT     "v=spf1 a:testrun.org -all"
```

I also added a Reverse DNS entry for testrun.org in the Hetzner Cloud Network
settings. You can find them here:
https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects/311332/servers/83974/network

After this, the spam issue was fixed.
